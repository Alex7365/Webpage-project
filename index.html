    <h1>10 Important information about rabbits</h1>
    <p>We have covered some facts about the cool abilities of rabbits. Now we will talk about the pros and cons of having a rabbit so you can decide if a rabbit is the right pet for you.</p>
    <h2>1. Rabbits are prey animals</h2>
    <p>Rabbits are prey animals which means they are being hunted by other animals such as eagles, foxes, and snakes. This means they are scared of other animals that are bigger than them. If you have a cat or a dog this could result in the rabbit being scared in
        your house. This does not mean you can't have a rabbit in a dog but it does mean that you will have to keep an eye on your rabbit until they get to know each other. </p>
    <h2>2. Rabbits are expensive</h2>
    <p>When we say a rabbit is expensive we do not mean that they want the finest carrots or lettuce, it means that they are hard to take care of. Rabbits are considered exotic animals; this means that they need doctors who specialize in rabbits. A yearly check-up can cost from $25 - $55, and an emergency medical need can cost hundreds of dollars</p>
    <h2>4. They are can be litter trained</h2>
      <p>Rabbits can be litter trained like cats and dogs. To train them first you have to assign a place where they can do their business. Then when they have accidents you can wipe it with a piece of paper and put that paper in the assigned place. Make sure to clean the odor of the place where they did their accident. This will allow them to smell where they did their business and learn the place where they should go.</p>
    <h2>5. They can adjust to your schedule</h2>
      <p>Rabbits are smart and can adapt to schedules. If you are worried that your rabbit will wake you up at night or too early, don't worry. Rabbits can adapt to your schedule, it just takes time.</p>
    <h2>6. Rabbits can learn tricks</h2>
      <p>Rabbits can learn some tricks. They can learn it just like dogs. Show them how it is done, then when they do it give them a treat, even if it was unintentional. Do it everyday for a few weeks. Then do it without a treat and they will get the hang of it after a while.</p>
    <h2>Is this the pet for you?</h2>
    <p>Based on all this information, would you consider a rabbit as your pet? If you think you will be able to handle them then keep reading to find out what you will need to provide a safe and friendly environment to run and play.</p>

    <h2>1. Hay</h2>
    <p>One of the most important foods for a rabbit is <em><strong>hay</strong></em>. A rabbit's diet is mostly 80%-90% hay. A brand that has good hay is from <em>Timothy</em>.</p>
    <h2>2. Broom</h2>
    <p>You, as the owner, will have to clean up after them and change their litter box. When you change it you will most likely spill some hay and will have to clean up.</p>
    <h2>3. A disinfectant</h2>
    <p>If you are training your rabbit to use the litter box then you should expect some accidents. Use a disinfectant to disinfect and take the odor away so the rabbit knows it shouldn't do that.</p>
    <h2>4. Treats</h2>
    <p>Rabbits should not eat a lot of treats just like we can't eat too much candy. Rabbits can have treats but it is recommended a small treat per day. You can ration the amount throughout the day if you want. Treats can also be used to teach them tricks or to train them to do something.</p>
    <h2>5. Keep cords away from your rabbit</h2>
    <p>One thing rabbits do is chew things. Rabbits could choose to chew your charging cable or any cable. This can be dangerous to the rabbit and expensive to you. One way is to put the cable out your rabbit's reach or to buy a coil that can wrap around your cable, thus protecting it.</p>
