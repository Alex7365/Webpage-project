    <h1>Important information about rabbits</h1>
    <p>We have covered some facts about the cool abilities of rabbits. Now we will talk about the pros and cons of having a rabbit so you can decide if a rabbit is the right pet for you.</p>
    <h2>1. Rabbits are prey animals</h2>
    <p>Rabbits are prey animals which means they are being hunted by other animals such as eagles, foxes, and snakes. This means they are scared of other animals that are bigger than them. If you have a cat or a dog this could result in the rabbit being scared in
        your house. This does not mean you can't have a rabbit in a dog but it does mean that you will have to keep an eye on your rabbit until they get to know each other. </p>
    <h2>2. Rabbits are expensive</h2>

      <p>Rabbbits can be litter trained like cats and dogs. To train them first you have to assign a place where they can do their business. Then when they have accidents you can wipe it with a piece of paper and put that paper in the assigned place. Make sure to clean the odor of the place where they did their accident. This will allow them to smell where they did their business and learn the place where they should go.</p>
    <h2>5. They can adjust to your schedule</h2>
      <p>Rabbits are smart and can adapt to schedules. If you are worried that your rabbit will wake you up at night or to early, don't worry. Rabbits can adapt to your schedule, it just takes time.</p>
